# Rain-Prediction

## The Case Study.
In this project, the aim is to determine if there will be rain in Australia tomorrow. The approach involves implementing Logistic Regression using Python and Scikit-Learn and as well comparing it performance with other selected machine learning classifiers.

The objective is to create a classifier that can predict the likelihood of rain tomorrow in Australia. This is achieved by training a binary classification model using Logistic Regression. The dataset employed for this project is the Rain in Australia dataset sourced from Kaggle
Dataset Source and Description.

Alt-H2
## Content
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia. RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.

## Context
Predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.
